#### About me
#####  Hello! My name is Vladimir Martyshevsky, I am a QA engineer. I took several software testing courses and was involved in the development of a small application for the App Store. I know the theoretical part of testing well. I also understand how the client-server architecture works. The tools I have worked with can be found below.
